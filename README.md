# iPhone Macros
Small scripts I (rarely) use with the iPhone Mirroring app.

## Currently includes:
- Game Pigeon Anagrams Bot

- Game Pigeon Word Hunt Bot
![word hunt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan1elTheMan1el/iphone-macros/refs/heads/main/demos/word_hunt_demo.mov)

Note:

Device proportions are kept in `resources/deviceParams.json`, and are preset to iPhone 13 Pro. Other devices have not been tested, and manual measuring will have to be done (Use `Cmd+Shift+4`)
